# thetanil-architect README

An extension for just me right now.

## Features

I draw pictures (drawio, plantuml, graphviz) and publish them with Sphinx. This
extension is to set up my VSCode with preview and build tasks for that.

## Requirements

This extension will recommend some other extensions which install the dependencies, like Python (graphviz and sphinx) and Java (plantuml).

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Known Issues

None so far.
